# Data-Wrangling-in-R--Assignment-1

This is the first assignment for Data Wrangling and formed part of my Graduate Certificate in Data Science.

This project required selecting a publically available data set and wrangling the data into a tidy form. The data set provides numerous statistics on reported cases for AIDS such as reported infections and mortality.

The attached code and report provides a detailed description of the data set and each of the columns. The report provides code and documents the libraries used and the steps taken to tidy and clean the data according to tidy data principals. Summary statistics are also given.
